                      <p>You can pay for Harvest via credit card either monthly or yearly. If you pay for the year in advance, you’ll get a 10% discount on your bill!
              If you have 10 or more seats and pay for the year in advance, you can also request an invoice when you upgrade and pay for your subscription via check or bank transfer.</p>

                      <p>If you’re paying monthly, you can add or remove seats at any time. Your price will be adjusted on your next monthly bill. If you have contractors or interns, or you anticipate the number of seats you’ll need may fluctuate from month to month, the monthly option is a better fit for you.
              If you paid for the year in advance, you can add seats at any time and will be charged a prorated amount based on the number of days left in your billing cycle. While you can’t remove seats during your current billing cycle, you can indicate inside your account if you’d like your yearly plan to renew with fewer seats. Keep in mind that yearly accounts receive a 10% discount, so if your seat requirements don’t change from month to month, yearly is probably the best option for you.</p>
